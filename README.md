# RBPG
This is the repository for the representative beach profile generator, created by Scott Spurgeon, USACE ERDC-CHL

The RBPG is an ArcGIS Pro ArcPy Toolbox that can easily generate a single characteristic profile for a given study area based on input profiles.
The toolbox uses outputs from the dune feature extraction toolbox, also an ArcGIS Pro toolbox, to align and average input profiles into a single profile based upon a chosen alignment feature.
Furthermore, the toolset allows the user to create a maximum and minimum trapezoidal profile approximations for use within numerical modeling. 

The files contained within this repository include the toolbox itself as well as example files from a USACE technical note by Spurgeon titled "Representative Beach Profile Generator", in which more information can be found.
